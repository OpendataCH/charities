# Data

You can find an initial **water dataset** in the `data` folder. This is exported from an Airtable-based survey which can be accessed at https://opendata.ch/water

# Preparation

Just edit the CSV file, which you can do directly in GitHub, send a Pull Request and we'll sync it. Raise an Issue if you need help.

To update the data file using Airtable, select the [Grid View](https://airtable.com/tblOl3otffKrCfFVt/viwOmo05mp4EChrFt?blocks=hide) (contact Oleg if you need access), click the ... menu and choose Download CSV. Rename it and copy into the data folder.
